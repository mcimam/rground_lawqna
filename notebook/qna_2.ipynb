    " Rescuers are searching through rubble and trying to reach isolated communities after a devastating earthquake struck Morocco, killing thousands and leaving more injured or unaccounted for.\n",
    "The quake is the strongest to hit the nation’s center in more than a century, and its epicenter was not far from popular tourist and economic hub Marrakech.\n",
    "At least 2,497 people have been killed in the disaster and 2,476 have been injured, state media said on Monday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what we know so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "When and where did the quake hit?\n",
    "The earthquake struck at around 11.11 p.m. local time (6.11 p.m ET) on Friday. Its epicenter was located in the High Atlas mountain range, about 72 kilometers (44.7 miles) southwest of Marrakech, a city of about 840,000 people.\n",
    "Its impact was felt far and wide, reaching as far north as Casablanca. But it most severely damaged towns and villages near the base of the Atlas Mountains, while also ripping through the center and suburbs of Marrakech. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quake had a magnitude of 6.8, meaning it is classed as “strong.” It also struck at a relatively shallow depth, making it more destructive.\n",
    "Morocco has suffered earthquakes in the past, but few in its history have been so powerful. This quake is Morocco’s deadliest since 1960, when an earthquake killed more than 12,000 people.\n",
    "Earthquakes of this size in the region are uncommon, according to the US Geological Survey, but not unexpected. It noted that nine quakes with a magnitude of 5 or higher have hit the area since 1900, but none of them have had a magnitude higher than 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly 1,500 people have died in the province of Al Haouz, where the quake was most devastating. The region, like many other badly affected locations, lies south of Morocco at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, and includes remote villages and settlements that have been difficult for rescuers to reach.\n",
    "Eyewitnesses in the foothills of the mountains said some towns are completely destroyed, with almost all the homes in an area of the village of Asni damaged.\n",
    "The scale of the quake’s impact is still becoming clear, but eyewitnesses CNN spoke to gave a sense of the destruction, especially in isolated villages that have been most badly hit. \n",
    "\n",
    " Soumia Sandoval, based in Los Angeles, California, told CNN she learned from family friends that their village at the base of the mountains was flattened by the quake. Mustapha Louaanabi, who also lives in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, described the moment the earthquake struck, saying there were “loud, deafening noises” and it felt as if “a train was passing right in the middle of the living room.”\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 400 meanwhile perished in the southwestern Moroccan city of Taroudant.\n",
    "And more than 300,000 people have been affected in Marrakech and surrounding areas, according to the WHO. Historic sites have been damaged there; a small mosque at the heart of the Marrakech Medina in the city’s historical quarter almost entire collapsed.\n",
    "The Marrakech Medina, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was hit by the quake. The Medina district dates back centuries and is enclosed by walls built of red sandstone. Many of the old buildings inside the Medina have been damaged and some have collapsed entirely.\n",
    "Outside the city, images showed the 12th century Tinmal Mosque in the High Atlas mountains had been badly damaged. \n",
